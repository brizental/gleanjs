# Sample usage of Glean.js in an electron app

This sample is based on the ["Writing Your First Electron App"](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app) guide.

To run this sample, just run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> **Note** Electron does not block on CORS, so there is no need for the CORS proxy when running this sample, in fact it will error if you try to use it.
